# Problem Details for HTTP APIs

For communicating the errors and exceptions to our API clients, we should specify a response format. In some cases, we would also like to let our users know what actually happened when something went wrong, instead of just telling them it was a 404 or 500 error.
If multiple clients consume our API, or if we need to use a selection of someone elseâ€™s APIs, it saves a lot of headaches to have this communication standardized.
